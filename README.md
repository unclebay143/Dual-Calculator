Abstract  
For this project, we chose to create a scientific calculator application, which can be used both on system and android devices which is compatible with python runtime.  
The purpose of the application was to provide users with the ability to perform calculations with a functional scientific calculator with a friendly Graphical User Interface.    
Using tkinter module toolkits, we were able to develop and implement most of the functionality required.

Introduction  
This report aims to provide a detailed look at the resulting application and some analysis of the research conducted which influenced the design decisions made.

Background  
At the beginning of the project, we had no previous experience with python tkinter development, so a large portion of time was dedicated to investigating, understanding and testing smaller bits of functionality, as well as looking at alternative implementations to figure out what we thought worked best.  
Ultimately, we had end up having to teach ourselves python application development, mostly relying on our abilities to apply the knowledge we accumulated over the last two years at name of University to different scenarios. As a result, a significant of the code in the application program has been adopted from the python documentation. There is also a small amount of code that was adopted from other sources - mostly from answers provided in StackOverflow, as well as various other tutorial sites/videos.

Project Brief  
The main goal of this project was to build a scientific calculator using python programming language with tkinter module, one of python’s popular module for creating Graphical User Interface.
The calculator works perfectly just like the usual scientific calculators been used in business settings, education institutions and can perform perfectly what it shows.

Development Platform:
The calculator was developed using the following medium
1.	Pycharm – Python most powerful IDE for the coding.
2.	Github – Used to track, maintain and make contributions to our project code as a team.
